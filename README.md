# Gunslinger
Angular frontend and Express backend. Simple scaffolding for diving into creating apps, all in CoffeeScript with `grunt` doing all the hard work. Please keep in mind that while CoffeeScript compiles down to JavaScript, you'll find yourself in a much happier place by [teaching yourself the basics of CoffeeScript with an hour's worth of attention](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/the-absolute-beginners-guide-to-coffeescript).

## Setup
Setup is pretty simple since the dependencies are included with the repo. If you aren't a fan of that kind of thing, too bad: this is easier for most people. To compile your `.coffee` files, simply type `grunt` from the command line (assuming you're currently in this directory).

## Tests
`grunt` or `grunt test` or `npm test` - whichever is easiest to remember for you :)
