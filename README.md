# Gunslinger (Client)
Angular frontend for prototyping apps quickly. Leans heavily on Firebase (free dev sandbox account) for auth as well as real-time communication.

## Setup
Setup is pretty simple since the dependencies are included with the repo. If you aren't a fan of that kind of thing, too bad: this is easier for most people. To compile your `.coffee` files, simply type `grunt` from the command line (assuming you're currently in this directory).

## Tests
`grunt` or `grunt test` or `npm test` - whichever is easiest to remember for you :)
