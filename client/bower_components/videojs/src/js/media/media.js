 * Set up click and touch listeners for the playback element
 * On desktops, a click on the video itself will toggle playback,
 * on a mobile device a click on the video toggles controls.
 * (toggling controls is done by toggling the user state between active and
 * inactive)
 *
 * A tap can signal that a user has become active, or has become inactive
 * e.g. a quick tap on an iPhone movie should reveal the controls. Another
 * quick tap should hide them again (signaling the user is in an inactive
 * viewing state)
 *
 * In addition to this, we still want the user to be considered inactive after
 * a few seconds of inactivity.
 *
 * Note: the only part of iOS interaction we can't mimic with this setup
 * is a touch and hold on the video element counting as activity in order to
 * keep the controls showing, but that shouldn't be an issue. A touch and hold on
 * any controls will still keep the user active
